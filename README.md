# Graph-Visualizer

This is a Graph Visualizer project that aims to give somewhat a real application of the graph algorithms. It helps to find the most optimal path between two points (more precisely the starting and the target point).

Currently it is supporting only Breadth-first Search(BFS) and Depth-first Search(DFS) algorithms.
